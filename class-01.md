# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
to summarize all we have learned when crating new website:

### First
Where do you start:
1. learning the languages that are used to do so:
HTML, CSS and JavaScript
2. who's your audience:
you have to know your audience before starting, how are old are they, do they have time to complicated processes, when will they visit your website, etc
3. designing your wireframe:
It is and imaginary look of the website where you decide what goes where, what colores are you going to use, sizes, imgaes and decorations...etc
4. choosing the best Text editor for you

### Second
1. using the HTML to add the contant to the page
HTML means Hyper Text Markup language whish cannot be cosidered a coding language as many dont know.
we start it with <!DOCTYPE html> to tell the broswer whish version of html we are using

It is used to add the contant of the page and section then into tags such as:

`<head>`

`<header>`

`<body>`

`<footer>`

those are the main tags but if you want more details in adding content you can use:

`<artical>` used to groub content

`<section>` usually used to groub content inside or out side the `<artical>`tag

`<div>` used to groub content aside each other

`<ol>` to add an ordered list 

`<ul>` to add an unordered list 

`<li>` list item

`<nav>` to add navigation bar

`<p>` for paragraphs

`<h1>` header 1 

`<h2>` header 2

*Note the one tage consist of openning and closing tags like `<ul></ul>`
and the contant is between them*

### Third
Here comes the CSS job wher eit adds the coloring and modification to your page
using CSS orders neither by typing in the same html file or by creating a file for it if you do so you have to link it to the html file.

you are able to change the size, order, color, aline, and adding slide shows, hovering effects and alots more.

you can customize a specific item by calling it by its tag, class or ID.

calling by tag will apply the changes for every tag of that kind 

Example:
`h1 {
  color: #00ff00;
}`

calling by class will apply the changes for every tag that have the class name

Example:
`.classname {
  color: #00ff00;
}`

calling by tag will apply the changes for tag that have that specific ID and the Id cant be used on more than one item
Example:

`# id {
  color: #00ff00;
}`

### Forth
#### The use of the JavaScript
JavaScript is a Frontend and Backend programming language that adds to the page, makes it alive.

like CSS you can choose to write it on the same file or seperated if you do so you have to link it to the html file.

Java adds rules to the page like when this occurs or what will happen after clicking this,

The JavaScripts writes on the html changing on it depending on the rules you typed.
