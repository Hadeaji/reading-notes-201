# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms
Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements.
`transform` property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.

### Transform Syntax

`div {`
  `-webkit-transform: scale(1.5);`
    `-moz-transform: scale(1.5);`
       `-o-transform: scale(1.5);`
          `transform: scale(1.5);`
`}`

The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses

### 2D Transforms
Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes

### 2D Rotate
  `transform: rotate(20deg);`

rotate and the rotation degree

### 2D Scale
Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1

## 2D Translate

The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.

`transform: translate(-10px, 25%);`

### 2D Skew
used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 

`transform: skew(5deg, -20deg);`

### 2D Cube Demo

`.cube {`
  `position: relative;`
`}`
`.side {`
  `height: 95px;`
  `position: absolute;`
  `width: 95px;`
`}`
`.top {`
  `background: #9acc53;`
  `transform: rotate(-45deg) skew(15deg, 15deg);`
`}`
`.left {`
  `background: #8ec63f;`
  `transform: rotate(15deg) skew(15deg, 15deg) translate(-50%, 100%);`
`}`
`.right {`
  `background: #80b239;`
  `transform: rotate(-15deg) skew(-15deg, -15deg) translate(50%, 100%);`
`}`

### Transform Origin

the default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically.
can accept one or two values.


### Perspective
In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform.

 `transform: perspective(200px) rotateX(45deg);`

the mmore you add to the value the more the depth is and the element will seem farther

### Perspective Origin
same values used for the transform-origin property may also be used with the perspective-origin property, and maintain the same relationship to the element.

## 3D Transforms
there is another axis along which we can transform elements.
Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

### 3D Rotate

including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

`.box-1 {`
  `transform: perspective(200px) rotateX(45deg);`
`}`
`.box-2 {`
  `transform: perspective(200px) rotateY(45deg);`
`}`
`.box-3 {`
  `transform: perspective(200px) rotateZ(45deg);`
`}`

### 3D Translate

Elements may also be translated on the z axis
A negative value here will push an element further away on the z axis, resulting in a smaller element.


### 3D Skew
Skew is the one two-dimensional transform that cannot be transformed on a three-dimensional scale

### Transform Style
The transform-style property needs to be placed on the parent element, above any nested transforms. The preserve-3d value allows the transformed children elements to appear in their own three-dimensional plane while the flat value forces the transformed children elements to lie flat on the two-dimensional plane.

### Transitions & Animations

### Transitions
an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:target` pseudo-classes.

`.box {`
  `background: #2db34a;`
  `transition-property: background;`
  `transition-duration: 1s;`
  `transition-timing-function: linear;`
`}`
`.box:hover {`
  `background: #ff7b29;`
`}`

### Transitional Property

The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an elementâ€™s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

`.box {`
    `background: #2db34a;`
    `border-radius: 6px`
    `transition-property: background, border-radius;`
    `transition-duration: 1s;`
    `transition-timing-function: linear;`
  `}`
  `.box:hover {`
    `background: #ff7b29;`
    `border-radius: 50%;`
  `}`

### Transitional Properties

### Transition Duration

The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the `transition-duration` property.
The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms).
These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.

### Transition Timing
The `transition-timing-function` property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move.

### Transition Delay
you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property.
The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing.



## Animations

## Animations Keyframes
set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the `@keyframes` rule.
The `@keyframes` rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

`@keyframes slide {`
  `0% {`
    `left: 0;`
    `top: 0;`
  `}`
  `50% {`
    `left: 244px;`
    `top: 100px;`
  `}`
  `100% {`
    `left: 488px;`
   `top: 0;`
  `}`
`}`

### Animation Name
Once the keyframes for an animation have been declared they need to be assigned to an element.
To do so, the animation-name property is used with the animation name

`.stage:hover .ball {`
  `animation-name: slide;`
`}`

### Animation Duration, Timing Function, & Delay

Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions.

### Animation Play State

`.stage:hover .ball {`
  `animation-name: slide;`
  `animation-duration: 2s;`
  `animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;`
  `animation-delay: .5s;`
  `animation-iteration-count: infinite;`
  `animation-direction: alternate;`
`}`
`.stage:active .ball {`
  `animation-play-state: paused;`
`}`
